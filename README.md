Repository Description
This repository contains the source code and dataset for analyzing and forecasting air quality, specifically PM2.5 levels, in Southwestern Morocco. The project utilizes an AIoT platform equipped with low-cost sensors to collect air quality data, which is then transmitted via WiFi/3G for analysis and prediction on a central server.

The main objectives of this study include:

Data Collection and Transmission: Using low-cost sensors to gather air quality data and transmit it in real-time.
Feature Selection: Implementing Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and LightGBM Recursive Feature Elimination (LightGBM-RFE) techniques to identify the most relevant features for PM2.5 prediction.
Model Optimization: Employing Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters of various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of different models using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).
The repository provides all necessary scripts and notebooks to replicate the data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and modeling processes used in this study.
